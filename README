just wanted to check in something since i was losing interest.. it currently works for ethernet based devices
only, but its pretty obvious where serial routines would go.

i support the complete command set as far as i know; and you should be able to do anything you can do from the remote, as well
as query the current values for things.

examples:

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Master Volume"
Master Volume is currently "40"

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Master Volume" -v 00
done.

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121:6048 -c "Master Volume" 
Master Volume is currently "00"

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Master Volume" -v 4C
done.

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Master Volume" -v 4E
done.

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Master Volume" -v 4F
done.

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Master Volume" 
Master Volume is currently "4F"

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -l | grep "HDMI"
"HDMI Output Select"

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -l | grep "Input"
"Input Select"

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Input Select" 
Input Select is currently "02"

albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Input Select" -v "03"
done.
albert:onkyo.py phar$ python onkyo.py -h  192.168.1.121 -c "Input Select" 
Input Select is currently "03"


todo:
	i dont currently tell you which keys, values or ranges are available for a given command so, sorry
	write a useful usage()
		some unsupported commands will return "N\A" but sometimes the receiever doesnt know what the fuck your talking about and just doesnt respond
	i dont currently handle a timeout gracefully
	implement a simple scripted server that consumes onkyo commands... only seems natural since many commands seem intended as integration
	with peripherals and might assist in cool home theatre setups
	notify onkyo of remotely exploitable protocol issue
